## Description


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic knowledge of Node.js as well as using Inquirer.js. The goal of the project is to generate a README.md using user input. 

The user is prompted with questions, the user will answer, and the answers are then pulled into a template and then a new file is generated based on those answers.

The generateMarkdown() function is imported from the /utils folder. The generateMarkdown() function is responsible for creating the template of the README.md and then filling in the content based on how the user responds. 

The newly generated README.md will be created in the /output folder.

Make sure Node.js and Inquirer.js are installed. Once they are installed, run the command 'node index.js' to start the program. When the program runs, the user prompts will appear in the terminal.
